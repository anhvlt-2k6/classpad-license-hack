# About the CASIO Software on the CASIO Calculator

## 1. What stores on ROM is the actual operating system or just a firmware?

Short answer: It is 99% the firmware
Long answer:

Based on the purpose, including the fixed apps, the size, and no adapted with new apps, it is the firmware

> ⚠️ I am only talking about the ClassWiz and Classic models. fx-CG50 and the CG models are at the other level. 

## 2. Types of software on CASIO Calculators

In CASIO Calculators, there are 2 different versions of software for the same purpose of calculating, with then have the same code name: Physical-based (?) and Emulator-based. For example, fx-880BTG on the market and the fx-880BTG on the emulator have the same codename of `EY-023`

The biggest difference between the two versions is that the emulator-based has removed OEM features, such as testing-calculator-on-demand (`AC+Catalog+Shift+On` on modern ClassWiz models and `7+Shift+On` on classic models). It is necessary because the firmware handles the hardware as well, while the emulator version only handles the calculation, while the hardware relies on the host operating system, including the memory validation.
